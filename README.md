## This is a sample project in .NET(C#) or Java to facilitate practicing refactoring patterns

### Process

The project provides a wealth of refactoring opportunities.

1. I would tweak 1 thing to cause the substitution test to fail before introducing to students and first ask them to fix the bug. Give them maybe 2 minutes.
2. Start progressively refactoring anywhere in the code whenever you are green.
3. Add tests as appropriate.
4. Go back and make the same change. See how long it takes the class to fix the same bug.

### Refactoring Opportunities

- Magic Numbers
- Long Methods
- Long Class
- Poor Naming
- Empty Catches
- Similar Code
- Unclear Tests
- Large Tests
